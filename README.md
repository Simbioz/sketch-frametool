# sketch-frametool

This plugin extracts layer frames as JSON.

Frames are copied relative to the first parent whose name ends with "[framing-root]". This suffix is required and allows choosing which layer represents the "root" in which we want to position the element. This suffix can be added to any parent group or even to the artboard itself.
